Here's a collection of my thoughts comparing various mod management methods for *Warhammer 40,000: Darktide*.

While I haven't used them all extensively, I know bit about each of them.

# Manual Installation
Ole reliable. 

## Auto Mod Loading and Ordering (AML)

## Servo-Modquisitor

# Mod Organizer 2
Mod Organizer 2 can be downloaded from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/latest).

While Darktide isn't officially supported by MO2, there is a [community plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/492) by Nyvrak and Merioni.

# Vortex

I actually don't have much experience with Vortex for Darktide.
