<p class="bodyContent">Links to notes from this site and to the <code>README</code> files for my other repositories.<br>
  You can only navigate back to this home page through the browser controls (no return links on the pages); I want to keep these isolated from the rest of this site's pages.
  <br><br>
  As a consequence of this, I am relying on the Jekyll Markdown to HTML converter to mkae these into pages. That is not perfect, especially with tables as it seems. <br>
  If any formatting is majorly broken, go to the original repository and view it through GitHub's web page.
