# Introduction
This is a walkthrough on how to use [Helldivers 2 Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109) (HD2MM) on Linux by using Steam and Proton. I'm assuming you have a cursory knowledge of filesystems and unzipping files.

# Installation
1) Download HD2MM and unzip it somewhere
2) Open Steam and add HD2MM as a non-Steam game
    1)  All the way at the top, click Game --> Add a Non-Steam Game to my Library --> Browse
    2)  Navigate to wherever you unzipped HD2MM and select the .exe
3) Setup Proton for HD2MM
    1) In your Steam Library, right click HD2MM
    2) Click Properties (This is where you can give it a cute name :3)
    3) In the menu on the left, click Compatibility
    4) Click Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool
    5) Select a Proton version (I use GE-Proton because that's what I use for the game itself)
4) Launch HD2MM through Steam

At this point, the HD2MM window should appear and work as it does on Windows. The only difference is the file pathing.

From this point on, follow the regular guides on how to use HD2MM.
