    <h1>Streamlined Process to Find Mod Updates</h1>
    For users who won't/can't use a mod manager that automatically checks for updates, you should make use of Nexus's Download History page. On this page, you can filter results by game and sort them by last updated. <br>

    <h1>Mod Requirements Section</h1>
    In the mod description, there is a collapsed section linking all required mods.<br>

    There is also a section linking all other mods that require this one. This is very useful when you're on the page for a framework mod, for example. In this next picture, you can see the Darktide Audio mod is used by a few other mods.<br>
