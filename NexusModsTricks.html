    <h1>Streamlined Process to Find Mod Updates</h1>
    For users who won't/can't use a mod manager that automatically checks for updates, you should make use of Nexus's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/myaccount?tab=download+history">Download History page</a>. On this page, you can filter results by game and sort them by last updated. <br>

    <h1>Mod Requirements Section</h1>
    In the mod description, there is a collapsed section linking all required mods. You can expand it by clicking the area depicted in the image, circled in pink.<br>
    There is also a section automatically linking all other mods that require this one. This is very useful when you're on the page for a framework mod, for example. Boxed in the picture, you can see the Darktide Extended Weapon Customization mod has a few other mods that require it.<br>
