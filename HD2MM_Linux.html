    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    This is a walkthrough on how to get various modding tools to work on Linux by using Steam and Proton.<br>
    I'm assuming you have a cursory knowledge of filesystems and unzipping files. <br>
    These are not the only methods that work! There are a few ways to get this running, but these are the ways that worked for me.
    <h1><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109">Helldivers 2 Mod Manager</a> - HD2MM - <a href="https://github.com/teutinsa/Helldivers2ModManager">(GitHub)</a></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Download HD2MM and unzip it somewhere</li>
        <li>Open Steam and add HD2MM as a non-Steam game</li>
            <ol>
              <li>All the way at the top, click Game --> Add a Non-Steam Game to my Library --> Browse</li>
              <li>Navigate to wherever you unzipped HD2MM and select the .exe</li>
            </ol>
        <li>Setup Proton for HD2MM</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In your Steam Library, right click HD2MM</li>
                <li>Click Properties (This is where you can give it a cute name :3)</li>
                <li>In the menu on the left, click Compatibility</li>
                <li>Click Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool</li>
                <li>Select a Proton version (I use GE-Proton because that's what I use for the game itself)</li>
            </ol>
        <li>Launch HD2MM through Steam</li>
    </ol>
      
    At this point, the HD2MM window should appear and work as it does on Windows. The only difference is the file pathing. It should look something like this.

    <br>
    However, Steam Deck players need another step. In this case, the game is installed in the `.local` folder, which HD2MM cannot access. A solution to this is to create a symlink pointing to your Steam library, and place it in an accessible folder. (Thanks to @DryRose in the Discord for sharing this).
    <br>
    From this point on, follow the regular guides on how to use HD2MM. <br>
    

    <h1><a href="https://github.com/Boxofbiscuits97/HD2SDK-CommunityEdition/releases/latest">HD2 Community SDK</a> for Blender</h1>
    When running Blender natively, trying to add the SDK will throw a <code>missing HDTool_Helper</code> error, regardless of version. <br>
    Also, I only set this up to repatch some abandoned mods. I never got it working, and I don't know if that's an issue with the SDK and Proton, or if it was just skill issue. <br>
    <br>
    All releases of Blender can be found <a href="https://download.blender.org/release/">here</a>, but you don't need that for this method.
    <ol>
      <li>Install <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365670/Blender/">Blender through Steam</a><br>
          By default, this will install v4.4, which is not compatible with the SDK. Rollback to v4.0 by:
      </li>
          <ol>
            <li>In your Steam Library, right click Blender</li>
            <li>Click Properties</li>
            <li>In the menu on the left, click Betas</li>
            <li>In Beta Participation, open the dropdown and select "v4.0 - Stable"</li>
          </ol>
      <li>Setup Proton for Blender</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In your Steam Library, right click Blender</li>
                <li>Click Properties</li>
                <li>In the menu on the left, click Compatibility</li>
                <li>Click Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool</li>
                <li>Select a Proton version (I use Proton 9.0-4 for no reason)</li>
            </ol>
      <li>Open Blender through Steam and follow the HD2 Modding Guide: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12SRK-LEdf_-m37FAFdKjXsjNidpBmzUeCm9-onlEFaM/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g30e14b88fc4_0_0">Workspace Setup section</a></li>
