    <h2>Running Jekyll Locally</h2>
    <p>First of all, check out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll">GitHub Pages guide</a><br>
    This is written with you having read that in mind, but just spelling out things for the slow people (me).<br>
    Having installed the prerequisites and cloned the repo, go to the local directory for the repo. Open the terminal there.<br>
    To run Jekyll, you need a Gemfile. Create it, such as through `touch Gemfile`, then add `gem 'jekyll'` to add that as a dependency.<br>
    The rest of the instructions are clear as is.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Buuuuut</i> for ease of copy pasting >:3<br>
    <code>
      bundle exec jekyll serve
      <br>
      http://localhost:4000
    </code>
    To add new gems, remember to use 'gem install' <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Linking Pages</h2>
    <ul>
      Various ways I've tried linking with GitHub Pages after I hadn't used HTML for years.
      Each entry has a score [0, 1], indicating if it works (and how well, ish)
      <li>[0 Relative Linking to same repo](StartupProcessCopy.md) I think this got deprecated</li>
      <li><a href="StartupProcessCopy.md">0.5 Link to file in the same repo. Raw file</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Backup158/StartupProcess/blob/main/README.md">1 Link to readme in different repo. Literally a link to that page (not the GitHub Pages)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://backup158.github.io/StartupProcess/">1 Hardlinking to another repo. Pulls up the readme (only thing there). Pulls up that repo's index.html otherwise. Make sure the pages source is set in the repo settings.</li>
      <li><a href="/StartupProcess/">1 Relative linking to another repo. Same caveats as hardlinking.</li>
      <li><a href="/StartupProcessCopy.md">0.7 Relative linking to file in same repo.</li>
      <li><a href="StartupProcessCopy.md"> Relative linking to file in same repo.</a> but without the folder indicator</li>
      <li><a href="/StartupProcessCopy.md">1 Relative linking to file in same repo.</a> but with proper formatting, you stupid bitch</li>
    </ul>
